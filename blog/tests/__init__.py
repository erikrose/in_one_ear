    This is a "model maker", a pattern that serves the same end as Django's
    fixtures but better. In anything but the smallest projects, fixtures tend
    to hurt performance (since they're by default reloaded before each test),
    comprehensibility (since fixture data is not lexically proximal to the test
    code that uses it) and maintainability (since they promote coupling between
    tests). Model makers fix all of these.

    The performance concerns can be ameliorated by doing crazy things like I
    describe in
    http://groups.google.com/group/django-developers/browse_thread/thread/
    65a36a8a5433144c (included in the current trunk of django-nose), but I
    didn't have time to throw together a release of that this weekend, and it
    doesn't solve the other two problems. I'll be giving a more comprehensive
    treatment in an upcoming PyCon talk:
    http://groups.google.com/group/django-developers/browse_thread/thread/
    65a36a8a5433144c.
